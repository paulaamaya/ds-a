## Insertion Sort
**Runtime:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

**Description:** Take a key and compare it to elements to its left.  As soon as we encounter an element that is less than, or equal to, the key we can stop.  Insert the key in that index, which will be the boundary of the sorted portion of the list.
