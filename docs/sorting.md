## Insertion Sort
**Runtime:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

**Description:** Insertion sort is am iterative sorting algorithm. Each element in the array is compared to those left of it, and swapped until its left neighbour is less than or equal to it.


## Merge Sort
**Runtime:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$

**Description:**  Merger sort is a recursive sorting algorithm.  Each half of the array is sorted independently, then the two sorted sub-arrays are merged into the original array in the correct order.
